# :red_circle: IMPORTANT DISCLAIMER :red_circle:

The current default branch [master] will be  completely replaced with branch [riscof-dev](https://github.com/riscv-non-isa/riscv-arch-test/tree/riscof-dev) on  **1st MAY 2022**.
This transition essentially migrates the current framework to the RISCOF framework.
This provides a much richer and configurable environment for targets to test their compatibility.
The current framework will be archived and **NO LONGER SUPPORTED AFTER 1st MAY 2022.**
It is therefore recommended that ALL model/target owners  migrate their targets to the riscof environment ASAP.
More information on porting your target to RISCOF is available here: https://riscof.readthedocs.io/en/stable/

# RISC-V Architecture Test SIG

This is a repository for the work of the RISC-V Foundation Architecture Test SIG. The repository owners are:

- Neel Gala (InCore Semiconductors)
- Marc Karasek (Inspire Semiconductors)

Details of the RISC-V Foundation, the work of its task groups, and how to become a member can be found at [riscv.org](https://riscv.org/).

For more details and documentation on the current testing framework see: [doc/README.adoc](doc/README.adoc)

For more details on the test format spec see: [spec/TestFormatSpec.adoc](spec/TestFormatSpec.adoc)

## Test Disclaimers

The following are the exhaustive list of disclaimers that can be used as waivers by target owners 
when reporting the status of pass/fail on the execution of the architectural suite on their respective targets.

1. The references uploaded for the following misaligned load/store tests will match targets which do 
   not support misaligned load/stores in hardware. Targets with hardware misaligned support for 
   load/stores will fail these tests.

   1. rv32i_m/privilege/src/misalign-[lb[u],lh[u],lw,sh,sb,sw]-01.S
   2. rv64i_m/privilege/src/misalign-[lb[u],lh[u],lw[u],ld,sb,sh,sw,sd]-01.S

2. The references uploaded for the following misaligned instruction tests will match targets which 
   have compressed extension support enabled by default. Targets without the compressed extension 
   support will fail the following tests:
   1. rv[32/64]i_m/privilege/src/misalign-b[ge[u],lt[u],eq,ne]-01.S
   2. rv[32/64]i_m/privilege/src/misalign2-jalr-01.S

3. The machine mode trap handler used in the privilege tests assumes one of the following conditions. 
   Targets not satisfying any of the following conditions are bound to fail the entire 
   rv32i_m/privilege and rv64i_m/privilege tests:
   1. The target must have implemented mtvec which is completely writable by the test in machine mode.
   2. The target has initialized mtvec, before entering the test (via RVMODEL_BOOT), to point to a memory location which has both read and write permissions.
