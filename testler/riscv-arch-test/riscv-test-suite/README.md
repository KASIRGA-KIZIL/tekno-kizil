# RISC-V Test Suites

The tests are grouped based on the different extension subsets of the RISC-V unprivileged ISA.
The tests strictly follow the [Test format](../spec/TestFormatSpec.adoc) specification.

Directory names postfixed with "\_unratified" indicate that tests for extensions that have not yet
been ratified by RVI.

The coverage report (in html format) of the tests available in this suite is generated through
[RISCOF](https://github.com/riscv-software-src/riscof) and is available here: [Coverage Report](../riscv-test-stats/coverage/README.md).

These tests have been generated using the open source Compatibility Test Generator from InCore Semiconductors available 
at: [CTG](https://github.com/riscv/riscv-ctg).

The reference signatures are generated using [SAIL](https://github.com/riscv/sail-riscv) or
[SPIKE](https://github.com/riscv-software-src/riscv-isa-sim).

Test directories with the "\_unratified" post-fix indicate test-suites for extensions which have not been
ratified (but are stable and near ratification)
